Spider Attack is the official name of the game used for the Spring Challenge 2022

Protect your base from the wave of monsters for longer than your opponent.

Two players control a team of heroes. Teams start at opposite corners of the map, near their base. Throughout the game, monsters will regularly appear around the edges of the map. If a monster reaches your base, it will inflict one point of damage. If your base takes too much damage, you lose.
